# CareerOdyssey
Locally hosted stock market api. 

## Description

This is a locally hosted api that allows you to create various objects based on the stock market like users, stocks, news, events and even markets. 

```
## My experience

I found myself researching things I thought I had completely mastered. Making models and following practices that were out of touch for me was alot of fun. Many times I found myself going through code line by line to locate the cause of some bug or other. all in all this was one of my favorite projects so far. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.

## tech used
```
node.js, express, sequelize, mongoDB, bcrypt, dotenv, cors, javascript.

```
